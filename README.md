# MLOps_labs


We simulated a real-world workflow involving two roles: the developer and the gatekeeper.

- We practiced doing the push and pull of code.
- The developer added files to the repo and the gatekeeper reviewed the changes.
- The gatekeeper confirms the merge.

  We learned the process of making changes, as the gatekeeper after review found that the requirements.txt files was missing.
  The necessary changes where made and the push/pull request process was renewed. 
  
This exercise gave us practical experience with:

- Branching and merging in Git

- Code review workflows

- Identifying and correcting common oversights
